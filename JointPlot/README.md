# EnergyAtlas
Interactive Visualization Development for the UCLA Energy Atlas

The code in this repo generates an interactive data visualization built off the [Bokeh python library] (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).
In this development version the visualization program logic runs server side on the local host.
In order to run the visualization:

1. First, clone the repo to a local directory of your choosing.

2. Then run the following command at the terminal/command prompt:

```bash
bokeh serve .../viz.py
```

3. Then fire up a browser window and direct to the following url:

```
localhost:5006/viz
```
